# --- Check for safe exceptions (one standalone rm of build artifacts) ---
# Match the complete command. Parsing only the last rm is unsafe because shell
# syntax or comments can hide an earlier destructive command, for example:
#   rm -rf / # rm -rf node_modules
# Unknown syntax fails closed and falls through to the destructive checks.
# Two hardenings on top of the anchored shape (#2039 wave):
#   - flag cluster accepts capital -R (BSD/macOS recursive), so a single
#     `rm -Rf node_modules` stays allowed instead of prompting;
#   - target tokens exclude `(` and backtick, so command substitution that
#     ENDS in a whitelisted suffix (`rm -rf $(./wipe-all)/node_modules`)
#     cannot ride the whitelist. Plain $VAR expansion (no parenthesis) is
#     still allowed.
#   - multi-line commands never ride the whitelist: grep matches the anchored
#     shape against EACH line, so `rm -rf /\nrm -rf node_modules` would be
#     allowed by its second line. With the JSON-parser extraction the \n in
#     the payload is a real newline (the old grep extractor kept it as two
